## How to contribute to ChaMP

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/CycloneTechnology/ChaMP/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/CycloneTechnology/ChaMP/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or adds to the documentation?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

While the original code for ChaMP has been contributed by Cyclone Technology Ltd, ongoing development is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in!
